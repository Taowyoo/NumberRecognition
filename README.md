# Simple Number Recognition App

## Project Description

This is a [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) GUI program build with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

THe program using [deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/) to load trained [HDF5 format model](src/main/resources/org/yuxiang/model.h5) to recognize handwirte number.

You can use mouse to write the number as input or choose number picture.

## File Description

I use [JupterNotebook](./NumberRecognition.ipynb) at root folder running on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to training the model by using MNIST dataset.

The [Demo Video](./Demo.mp4) shows once use of the app.
